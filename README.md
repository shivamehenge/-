#Project :-



This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.



The data set consists of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.



#The steps involved are:-



1. Importing different Package and Libraries of Python

2. Load the Dataset

3. Showing the information of given Dataset

4. Description of Dataset

5. Plotting the Information using the Matplotlib and Seaborne

6. Testing the Model

7. Model Checking and Classification Report

8. Testing the Model
